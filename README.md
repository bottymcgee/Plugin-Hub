## 📦 Adding a Plugin to the Hub

To make your plugin available through the Plugin Hub:

### Step 1: Prepare Your Plugin
1. Ensure your plugin follows the [plugin development guidelines](https://github.com/Highl1te/Example-Plugin/)
2. Create a release in your plugin repository
3. Note the SHA hash of your release asset

### Step 2: Add to Plugin Hub
1. **Fork this repository**
2. **Create a new JSON file** in the `plugins/` directory:
   ```
   plugins/your-plugin-name.json
   ```
3. **Configure your plugin** using this template:
   ```json
   {
       "repository_owner": "YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME",
       "repository_name": "YOUR_PLUGIN_REPO_NAME",
       "asset_sha": "sha256:YOUR_RELEASE_ASSET_SHA"
   }
   ```
4. **Submit a Pull Request** with your changes

### Step 3: Get Your Asset SHA
The `asset_sha` is required for security and version tracking:

1. Go to your plugin's GitHub releases page
2. Find the release you want to distribute
3. Click on the release asset (typically `PluginName.js`)
4. Copy the SHA256 hash from the asset details
5. Format it as: `sha256:YOUR_HASH_HERE`

## 🔄 Updating a Plugin

When you release a new version of your plugin:

1. **Find your plugin file**: Locate `plugins/your-plugin-name.json`
2. **Update the asset SHA**: Change the `asset_sha` field to point to your new release
3. **Submit a Pull Request**: Include a brief description of what's new

### Example Update
```json
{
    "repository_owner": "YourUsername",
    "repository_name": "AwesomePlugin",
    "asset_sha": "sha256:NEW_SHA_HASH_FOR_LATEST_RELEASE"
}
```
